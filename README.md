WAMP-RS
=======

WAMP-RS is a Rust implementation of the
[Web Application Messaging Protcol (WAMP)](http://wamp-proto.org/).

At present the entire Basic Profile is supported, as well as pattern based subscriptions and registrations from the Advanced Profile.

For instructions on how to use, please see the [examples](examples) directory.

To include in your project, place the following in your `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
wamp = "0.1"
```

WAMP-RS uses [serde-rs](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde), which requires Rust 1.15 or greater.
